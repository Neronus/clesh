  :description ("Clesh is a very short program that provides
  mechanisms for running and composing Unix shell commands and
  constructs from Common Lisp.

Essentially, it provides a '!' syntax that you can use to run commands
and a '[]' embedded mode where you can enter bash scripts and obtain
the standard output as a lisp string, and some other features.

Lisp expressions can be included in any command or script using a '?'
syntax.

Clesh works on every implementation of Common Lisp that is supported
by trivial-shell."))
